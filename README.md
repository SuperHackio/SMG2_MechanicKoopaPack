# SMG2 MechanicKoopaPack
### Mecha Bowser in SMG2

This is a port of some Mapparts that were used for Mecha Bowser in Super Mario Galaxy, including the Head, which is what controls the Power Star spawning. This was done using [Petari](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Petari) and the skilled contributions from @shibbo of the SMGCommunity Decompilation Team.

Below is a list of everything included:
- The ObjectData archives for all Mapparts used in the Mecha Bowser boss battle.
- The "MechaKoopaPartsHead", "MechaKoopaPartsArmLeft", "MechaKoopaPartsArmRight" objects in the Editor
- The "RailMoveObjBreakAtEnd", "RailMoveObjSwitchShadow", and "MechaKoopaPartsArm" ProductMapObjDataTable classes.
- An edited ActionSound.arc file that includes edits that were made to ActionSound
- An edited Effect.arc file that includes particle effects for all included objects

Below is a list of other things that you will need:
- [MechaKoopaPartsHead object documentation](https://smgcommunity.github.io/galaxydatabase/config_MechaKoopaPartsHead.html)
- [MechaKoopaPartsArm object documentation](https://smgcommunity.github.io/galaxydatabase/config_MechaKoopaPartsArm.html)
- A level editor

Setting up Mecha Bowser works the same way that it does in SMG1.

## Looking for the Screws?
The screws used in the Mecha Bowser fight are not part of this module, as they are part of a separate module.
We don't have a proper home for it just yet, but once we do, it'll be linked here.
